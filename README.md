# OrderBook

## Summary
When I was working on a project related to displaying some stock market data, I found myself stuck on coming up with a way to display the order book of a market. There were no helpful libraries or sources to help me with the design of such order book. This is why I created this cool React Component which anyone can us in the future to create their own order book. Feel free to download and use it as you want.
